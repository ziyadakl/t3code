# T3 Cloud Clerk Setup

T3 Cloud uses one Clerk application for web, desktop, and mobile authentication. The relay accepts
Clerk JWTs only when they are generated from the `t3-relay` template with the shared
`t3-code-relay` audience.

## Application Keys

T3 Cloud is disabled in a fresh clone. To enable it for source builds, add a repository-root `.env`
or `.env.local` file:

```dotenv
T3CODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<publishable key>
T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=<JWT template name>
T3CODE_RELAY_URL=https://relay.example.com
```

The shared client loader projects these canonical values into framework-specific `VITE_*` and
`EXPO_PUBLIC_*` aliases. Existing aliases remain accepted as overrides for compatibility, but new
client configuration should use the canonical names.

Configuration precedence is:

1. Process or CI environment variables.
2. Repository-root `.env.local`.
3. Repository-root `.env`.

The Clerk publishable key, JWT template name, and relay URL are public identifiers, not secrets.
Web, desktop, and mobile builds statically inject them during their build step. A built artifact
does not need an environment file at runtime. CI release builds should set
`T3CODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`, and `T3CODE_RELAY_URL` before building.
EAS preview and production builds should define the same client-facing values in their EAS
environment.

When any client-facing public value is absent, cloud UI is omitted.

For a hosted relay deployment, copy `infra/relay/.env.example` to `infra/relay/.env`. The relay
deployment reads `RELAY_DOMAIN`, `RELAY_ZONE_NAME`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and
`CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE` through Effect `Config`. There are no checked-in deployment defaults.
`bun --cwd infra/relay run deploy` invokes Alchemy from the relay directory, so Alchemy loads
`infra/relay/.env`. After a successful deployment, the wrapper updates the repository-root `.env`
with the HTTPS relay URL derived from `RELAY_DOMAIN`. The relay still requires
`CLERK_SECRET_KEY` as an Alchemy secret. Never put `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in a client application
environment or commit it to the repository.

The `prod` Alchemy stage owns the retained PlanetScale database. Non-production stages reference
that database and provision isolated PlanetScale branches, so deploy `prod` before creating a
preview or developer stage.

## Headless CLI OAuth Application

The `t3 cloud` commands authorize a headless environment with a separate Clerk OAuth application.
This uses an OAuth public client with PKCE, so the CLI stores no client secret.

In **Clerk Dashboard > OAuth applications**:

1. Create an OAuth application for the T3 CLI.
2. Enable the **Public** option so authorization-code exchange uses PKCE.
3. Add `http://127.0.0.1:34338/callback` as an allowed redirect URI.
4. Enable the `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes.
5. Set the relay deployment's `CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` to the generated public client ID.

The CLI supports these headless operations:

```sh
t3 cloud link
t3 cloud status
t3 cloud unlink
t3 serve
```

`t3 cloud link` installs the pinned managed `cloudflared` binary when needed, opens the Clerk
authorization flow, and records durable intent to expose the environment. It works without a
running T3 server. If no server is running, the next `t3 serve` or `t3 start` reconciles the relay
link and launches the managed tunnel. `t3 cloud unlink` records disabled intent immediately,
stops a reachable running connector, and attempts to revoke the relay-side environment record.

The current OAuth callback listener binds to loopback port `34338`. When running the CLI over SSH,
forward that port before running `t3 cloud link`:

```sh
ssh -L 34338:127.0.0.1:34338 <host>
```

A relay-hosted callback broker can remove this port-forward requirement later without changing the
stored PKCE token model.

## JWT Template

In **Clerk Dashboard > JWT templates**, create a template with:

| Setting | Value                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Name    | `t3-relay`                   |
| Claims  | `{ "aud": "t3-code-relay" }` |

Set `T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE=t3-relay` in the repository-root `.env`, and set
`CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE=t3-code-relay` in `infra/relay/.env`. Define `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE` and
`CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE` in the production relay deployment environment as well. The stable `aud` value
is shared by production and non-production relay stages. The client-facing `T3CODE_RELAY_URL` still
selects the concrete relay deployment, but changing that URL does not require a JWT template change.

## Desktop OAuth Redirect Allowlist

The desktop app opens OAuth in the system browser and returns to the app with a custom URL scheme.
In **Clerk Dashboard > Native applications**, enable native application support and add these
entries under the mobile SSO redirect allowlist:

```text
t3code-dev://auth/callback
t3code://auth/callback
```

The first entry is for local desktop development. The second is for packaged desktop builds.
The app also adds a request-scoped `t3_state` query parameter and validates it on callback.

The current mobile UI uses Clerk's native authentication view. If a future mobile browser OAuth
flow uses a custom redirect URI, add that exact URI to the same allowlist.

## Enable Waitlist Access

For a private beta where people should request access, use **Clerk Dashboard > Waitlist**:

1. Toggle on **Enable waitlist** and save.
2. Review requests on the same page and select **Invite** or **Deny**.

Signed-out web and desktop users see Clerk's waitlist enrollment as the T3 Cloud page content,
while approved signed-in users see cloud settings. The browser app also uses `/settings/cloud` as
its Clerk waitlist URL.

On mobile, signed-out users open **Settings > T3 Account** to reach `/settings/waitlist` within the
Settings form sheet. It submits enrollment through Clerk's `useWaitlist()` flow because the prebuilt
`<Waitlist />` component is web-only in the Expo SDK. Approved users can use **Sign in** from that
screen.

## Alternative: Known-User Allowlist

For a closed beta where all permitted users are known in advance, use an allowlist instead of a
request-and-approval waitlist:

To restrict the beta to permitted email addresses or domains:

1. In **Clerk Dashboard > Restrictions > Allowlist**, add each permitted email address or email
   domain.
2. Enable the allowlist and save.
3. Alternatively, enable **Restricted mode** when all new users must be explicitly invited or
   manually created without a waitlist request flow.

Do not enable an empty allowlist: it blocks all new sign-ups.

Clerk allowlists control who can sign up. They do not revoke an existing user's active cloud
access. To remove an already-created user's access, ban that user in Clerk so their active
sessions are ended and future sign-ins are rejected.
