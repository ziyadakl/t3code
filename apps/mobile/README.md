# T3 Code Mobile

> [!WARNING]
> T3 Code Mobile is currently in development and is not distributed yet. If you want to try it out, you can build it from source.

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> Uses native modules so using Expo Go is not supported. You need to use the Expo Dev Client.

This app has three variants:

- `development`: Expo dev client, installable side-by-side as `T3 Code Dev`
- `preview`: persistent internal preview build, installable side-by-side as `T3 Code Preview`
- `production`: store/release build as `T3 Code`

Run commands from `apps/mobile`.

T3 Cloud is optional and disabled in a fresh clone. Public configuration belongs in the
repository-root `.env` or `.env.local`, not an `apps/mobile/.env` file. See
[`../../.env.example`](../../.env.example).

## Development

Start Metro for the dev client:

```bash
bun run dev:client
```

Build and run the local iOS dev client:

```bash
bun run ios:dev
```

Build and run the local iOS preview app:

```bash
bun run ios:preview
```

Force the review diff highlighter engine:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEW_HIGHLIGHTER_ENGINE=javascript bun run ios:dev
```

`javascript` is the default and recommended setting for the review diff screen. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEW_HIGHLIGHTER_ENGINE=native` only when you explicitly want to test the native Shiki engine.

Inspect the resolved Expo config for a variant:

```bash
bun run config:dev
bun run config:preview
```

Run static checks for mobile native code:

```bash
node ../../scripts/mobile-native-static-check.ts
```

The native lint task runs SwiftLint for Swift plus ktlint and detekt for Kotlin. Missing native tools are reported as warnings and skipped locally. CI installs the default toolset from `apps/mobile/Brewfile` before running the native checks.

## EAS Builds

For preview or production EAS environments, set `T3CODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `T3_RELAY_URL`
as EAS environment variables. Expo config maps the canonical values into the mobile build.

Create a cloud dev-client build:

```bash
bun run eas:ios:dev
```

Create a persistent preview build:

```bash
bun run eas:ios:preview
```

Android equivalents:

```bash
bun run eas:android:dev
bun run eas:android:preview
```
